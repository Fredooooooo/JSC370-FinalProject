# Research into factors affecting the performance of tennis players in ATP

This is my JSC370 Final Project website repository. 

The project involves a research into factors affecting the performance of tennis players in Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). I will use various statistical approaches and machine learning models aiming to provide some insights into the performance of tennis players based on certain characteristics. The project aim to answer the following two questions:
1. How could some physical factors and experience of a tennis player be used to explain the variation observed in rankings of 639 players participated in 2017 ATP tournaments. 
2. Given the physical characteristics and experience of a player, how can we predict his ranking in a range of 2074 tennis players from ATP?
